        <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
        <p>Do you like to think outside the box? Do you think it is more important to stand out than to fit in? Would you like to share your creativity with the world? Well, you have come to the right place! This site is meant to be a place where you can freely express yourself through works such as poems, short stories, novels, games, art, photography, and songs. We love to hear different persepectives presented by different people of different ages and backgrounds.</p>
        <h2>Our Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>If you want to post something for a more mature audience, make sure to indicate that when uploading.</li>
            <li>Please refrain from using rude humor such as racist comments or something a particular group of people would find offensive (you can email us your draft first if you are unsure).</li>
            <li>NO PLAGIARISM. Make sure to CITE YOUR SOURCES!!!</li>
            <li>Have Fun! :D Don't be afraid to show us who you really are. This website is a supposed to be a safe haven. We're all a family here and if Lilo and Stitch have taught us anything, it's that:</li>

       <p>Hi! I'm Imani and I really enjoy reading and writing fiction. I started this website because I know there are tons of people like me who really want to share our creativity with the world but don't really know how. I started this website when I was 13 (if you can't already tell from the picture above :P) and had just finished 9th grade at <a href= "https://www.fjuhsd.org/domain/13" target="_blank">Troy High School</a>. My parents are both from Africa, but I was born and raised in Southern California. I have a younger sister named Imara and A LOT of cousins. I took creative writing class in 8th grade and continue to write in my free time. Anyway, enough about me. This website was designed for YOU. So go out and show the world who YOU are through whatever type of creativity you'd like!</p>
